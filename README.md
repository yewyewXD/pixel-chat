# Pixel Chat

## Motivation

On 24 Nov 2021, there was a weekly challenge in [Moralis DAO](https://discord.com/invite/wV7nkDYGyZ), which is to build a multiplayer game using their starter boilerplate. The reward will be a unique NFT that you could only get by winning the challenge (or resales).
<br>
<br>
I have been dreaming to hold something like this from Moralis Web3, my dream company, so I hopped on this challenge, even with 0 experience in game development.
